Where Used Service – Reference Guide
1. Concept Overview
The "Where Used" service tracks and manages dependencies between metadata objects (e.g.,
extension fields, validations, UI fields) in SAP CXM. Its main purpose is to provide visibility into where
an object is used, supporting safe deletion, impact analysis, and dependency management.

2. Key Features
Up-front Dependency Tracking: Dependencies are recorded as soon as they are created or removed,
via standard events.
Supported Dependency Types:
Hard Dependency: Must be removed before deleting the target object.
Soft Dependency: Target can be deleted; dependent objects may require cleanup.
No Maintenance: No tracking needed; consumer adjusts itself.
Extensible Registry: All participants (object types) and their relationships are registered in a central
registry.
Event-Driven Updates:
Events: createDependency, deleteDependency, updateDependencyForSource
Consumers must emit these events to keep the dependency graph up to date.
APIs:
gRPC and REST APIs to add, remove, update, and query dependencies.
Supports mass operations and initial load for onboarding or data sync.
Tenant Copy Support: All dependencies are copied and synchronized during tenant lifecycle
operations.

3. Typical Dependency Scenarios
| Object | Usage In | Context Info | Dependency Type |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Extension Fields | Validation | Entity, Custom Logic ID | Hard |
| Extension Fields | Determination | Entity, Custom Logic ID | Hard |
| Extension Fields | Autoflow | | Hard |
| Extension Fields | Approval | | Hard |
| Extension Fields | UI Data fields | UI View name, Parent UI context, Field Set | Soft |
| Extension Fields | CLR (Code List Restriction) | | Hard |

consumers include: Validation, Determination, Autoflow, Approval, CLR (Code List Restriction).

4. Example Use Case
An extension field used in a UI view is tracked as a dependency. Before deleting the field, the service
can show all UI views where it is used, preventing accidental data loss.

5. API/Event Usage
Add Dependency Event
Remove Dependency Event
Replace Dependency Event

6. Troubleshooting
If you are unable to remove a field, it is likely referenced by other objects or services (e.g., Validation,
Determination, Autoflow, Approval, CLR). Use the "Where Used" feature or API to list all usages and
remove or update dependent references before deletion.
